### Gennaro Eduardo Tangari 👋
Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile. 
My name is Gennaro Eduardo Tangari, I'm currently working as Senior Solution Architect at Avanade Germany and I'm an Ex Solution Architect at Microsoft, experienced with Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Dynamics 365 (CRM) and .NET. Is that all? Nope, in the spare time, I also develop apps for macOS and iOS. You can find a couple of them in the App Store.

What am I doing?

🔭 I’m currently working on some new cool applications ... sorry, no public repository 🤐 

🌱 I’m currently learning new frameworks for the development of desktop applications 😆

What can you find here? I have a couple of repositories I use to share demo projects and/or samples about the fundamentals of software development.
This content is usually created in with the programming languages and frameworks I love most.
